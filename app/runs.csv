2025-08-11,1,Monday,Easy Run,1.5,00:15:01,9:57,181,"South Barrington, Road",80,3,First run of marathon training. Just tried to run at a very slow pace and see how my body felt. Ran into Ashley so ran with her for a bit. But I am really excited to get more milage down and strengthening my legs as I get closer to running the full marathon in November. Run felt really good!
2025-08-13,1,Wednesday,Easy,3.45,00:30:12,8:44,547,"Chicago, City",74,4,Second run of training in the city. I just want to up my milage and strengthen my legs so my body gets used to running big distances. This is definitely going to be my hardest physical feat I have ever put my mind to. I am excited for the suffering I will have to endure in the near future to accomplish running my first marathon!
2025-08-14,1,Thursday,Easy,2.17,00:21:13,9:44,344,"Chicago, City",73,2,"Third run of training was a chill night run. Least effort run so far just trying to get more milage in so my body can handle running 26 miles. It is crazy to me that I will be running a marathon in under three months. I honestly do not feel scared but excited for the challenge ahead. I have not done something this hard in a long time and I know I will grow from this experience. Anyways, going to prioritizing getting good rest every night and stretching!"
2025-08-15,1,Friday,Easy,2.23,00:20:31,9:10,352,"Chicago, City",76,4,"I did not get a run in today so after Munachi's bday I decided to jog back to my apartment and I am very happy I did that. However, I just wore my sambas and it really hurt my feet so I need to make sure to always have my insoles in. Jogging at a slow pace is starting to feel good just need to up the milage!"
2025-08-17,1,Sunday,Long Run,6.60,00:59:17,8:59,1042,"Chicago, City",78,4,Broke up the miles between me going to a bar to watch Manchester United play Arsenal and then going to get a beard trimmer at target. After hitting around the four mile mark I felt a runners high so once I hit this milage I will be flying. First week of marathon training has officially finished!
2025-08-19,2,Tuesday,Easy Run,2.18,00:24:23,11:11,242,"Riverwoods, Treadmill",73,3,"This run was supposed to be 3 miles long but I did not have enough time to do this. However, I feel like I definitely ran that much but the miles counter on the machine was not working properly. Anyways, this was the first treadmill run of training and I very much prefer running outside but this is really easy on the knees."
2025-08-20,2,Wednesday,Training Run,5.02,00:46:24,9:14,790,"Chicago, Lakeshore path",70,5,Did not feel like running today but I got in the miles with Ryan. I think I run faster by myself but I will have to test this hypothesis later on. I think this was the most difficult run so far but my body is starting to get used to running longer so I am very happy with my progress one week into training
2025-08-22,2,Friday,Training Run,3.13,00:27:53,8:55,494,"Chicago, Lakeshore path",70,4,Morning run with Kaycie to jump in the lake. Body is feeling really good as I get these miles in. The weekly runs have been really good since I am almost done with week 2 of training. I have found that I run much better without music because I am fully concentrated on my breathing. So with the rest of my training no more music.
2025-08-24,2,Sunday,Long Run,6.04,00:56:58,9:25,953,"Chicago, City",74,3,Second long run. This one felt really good. My body is getting used to the long runs and mentally I feel extremely strong. Went at a slow pace too so I will gradually improve that as time goes on by. My main priority now is to do leg and body workouts along with running for the upcoming weeks so I become my strongest physical self. 
2025-08-26,3,Tuesday,Easy Run,2.96,00:26:53,9:03,471,"South Barrington, Road",67,4,First run of week 3. My legs are feeling really good and have started to incorporate full body workouts into my week. But on this run I did not stop much and ran throughout which is something that I need to do a better job of because in the city I generally just stop a lot at traffic stops for example. 
2025-08-27,3,Wednesday,Training Run,6.04,00:56:32,9:21,954,"Chicago, Lakeshore path",70,4,"Not feeling as sore after these six mile runs which means that my legs are getting much stronger. Going to have to increase my pace for shorter runs in the coming weeks so that my average pace gets faster before running the entire marathon."
2025-08-28,3,Thursday,Night run,2.32,00:20:31,8:49,367,"Chicago, City",63,3,Me and Kaycie broke things off so I just needed to clear my head so I went on this run. Mental health run :) 
2025-09-01,3,Monday,Long Run,7.51,01:12:40,9:41,1189,"Hoffman Estates, Forest Preserve",76,4,"Week three of Madison marathon training has officially come to an end. Running a forest preserve is also such a good vibe and I want to most definitely include these types of runs in the future. Also, me and Kaycie have officially broken things off so running is going to be a really good outlet for moving on in the near future. The long run felt really good I just need to do a better job of when I am tired to jog slowly and not walk because that would really improve my overall time. Going to buy a running belt too in the very near future as well!"
2025-09-03,4,Wednesday,Training Run,6.85,01:02:21,9:06,1078,"Chicago, streets",66,5,Ran from my new apartment in Bucktown to Lincoln park and it was such a vibe. I just need to make sure I stretch well after run and eat a lot of food. My legs are starting to feel extremely good just have to keep strengthening them at the gym which is exactly what I am planning to do tomorrow at Depaul.
