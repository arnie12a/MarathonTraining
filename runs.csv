2025-08-11,1,Monday,Easy Run,1.5,00:15:01,9'57'',"South Barrington, Road",80,3,First run of marathon training. Just tried to run at a very slow pace and see how my body felt. Ran into Ashley so ran with her for a bit. But I am really excited to get more milage down and strengthening my legs as I get closer to running the full marathon in November. Run felt really good!
