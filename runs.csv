2025-08-11,1,Monday,Easy Run,1.5,00:15:01,9'57'',181,"South Barrington, Road",80,3,First run of marathon training. Just tried to run at a very slow pace and see how my body felt. Ran into Ashley so ran with her for a bit. But I am really excited to get more milage down and strengthening my legs as I get closer to running the full marathon in November. Run felt really good!
2025-08-13,1,Wednesday,Easy,3.45,00:30:12,8:44,547,"Chicago, City",74,4,Second run of training in the city. I just want to up my milage and strengthen my legs so my body gets used to running big distances. This is definitely going to be my hardest physical feat I have ever put my mind to. I am excited for the suffering I will have to endure in the near future to accomplish running my first marathon!
