2025-08-11,1,Monday,Easy Run,1.5,00:15:01,9:57,181,"South Barrington, Road",80,3,First run of marathon training. Just tried to run at a very slow pace and see how my body felt. Ran into Ashley so ran with her for a bit. But I am really excited to get more milage down and strengthening my legs as I get closer to running the full marathon in November. Run felt really good!
2025-08-13,1,Wednesday,Easy,3.45,00:30:12,8:44,547,"Chicago, City",74,4,Second run of training in the city. I just want to up my milage and strengthen my legs so my body gets used to running big distances. This is definitely going to be my hardest physical feat I have ever put my mind to. I am excited for the suffering I will have to endure in the near future to accomplish running my first marathon!
2025-08-14,1,Thursday,Easy,2.17,00:21:13,9:44,344,"Chicago, City",73,2,"Third run of training was a chill night run. Least effort run so far just trying to get more milage in so my body can handle running 26 miles. It is crazy to me that I will be running a marathon in under three months. I honestly do not feel scared but excited for the challenge ahead. I have not done something this hard in a long time and I know I will grow from this experience. Anyways, going to prioritizing getting good rest every night and stretching!"

However, I just wore my sambas and it really hurt my feet so I need to make sure to always have my insoles in. Jogging at a slow pace is starting to feel good just need to up the milage!"
